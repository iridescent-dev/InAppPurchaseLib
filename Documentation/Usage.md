The process of implementing in-app purchases involves several steps:
1. Displaying the list of purchasable products
2. Initiating a purchase
3. Delivering and finalizing a purchase
4. Checking the current ownership of non-consumables and subscriptions
5. Implementing the Restore Purchases button

*Note:* You have to `import InAppPurchaseLib` wherever you use the library.
