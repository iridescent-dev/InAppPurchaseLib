If you haven't already, I highly recommend your read the *Overview* and *Preparing* section of Apple's [In-App Purchase official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase).

## Requirements
* Configure your App and Xcode to support In-App Purchases.
  * [AppStore Connect Setup](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devb57be10e7)
* Create and configure your [Fovea.Billing](https://billing.fovea.cc/?ref=iap-swift-lib) project account:
  * Set your bundle ID
  * The iOS Shared Secret (or shared key) is to be retrieved from [AppStoreConnect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
  * The iOS Subscription Status URL (only if you want subscriptions)
